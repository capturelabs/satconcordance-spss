Example recode statements in SPSS to concord new and old SAT values

## Overview
Each .txt file in this repository provides the SPSS syntax to RECODE an SAT or ACT variable into a new or old format. The name of each file reflects the transformation contained in the file. Simply change the variable names in the RECODE statement to correspond to your variable names. Each .txt file contains a reproducible example that demonstrates the behavior of the RECODE command. The examples generate 10 sample records, then generate 10 feasible starting values in a new variable, and finally generate an ending variable that contains the recoded scores. View the resulting variables in the Data View window.
