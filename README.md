Example recode statements in SPSS® to concord new and old SAT® values

## Overview
Each .txt file in this repository provides the SPSS® syntax to RECODE an SAT® or ACT® variable into a new or old format. The name of each file reflects the transformation contained in the file. Simply copy/paste the RECODE command into your syntax file, and change the variable names in the RECODE statement to correspond to your variable names. Each .txt file contains a reproducible example that demonstrates the behavior of the RECODE command. The examples generate 10 sample records, then generate 10 feasible starting values in a new variable, and finally generate an ending variable that contains the recoded scores. View the resulting variables in the Data View window.
